Great — I’ll give you one single, ready-to-copy response that contains:

1. The full **SOC Roadmap text** (exactly what will appear in the PDF) so you can copy it directly.
2. A **ready-to-run Python script** that generates a polished PDF (`SOC_Roadmap.pdf`) with clickable links.
3. **Simple step-by-step instructions** to run it (no prior knowledge assumed).

Copy everything below into a file and run it. I included commonly-used, stable URLs (Splunk, TryHackMe, Security Onion, MITRE ATT&CK, etc.) so your PDF has direct links.

## 1) Full SOC Roadmap — copy this text anywhere

**Title:** SOC Roadmap — Beginner → Advanced
**Author:** Cyber Security Specialist

---

### Overview

This single-file learning roadmap helps you become a SOC analyst — from foundations to advanced threat hunting and forensics. Resources are labeled **[Free]** or **[Paid]**.

---

### Phase 0 — Plan & Timeline

Suggested 6–12 month plan:

* Months 0–2: Foundations — Networking, OS, basic security.
* Months 3–4: Core SOC skills — SIEM, log analysis, incident response.
* Months 5–6: Hands-on labs, build home SOC lab.
* Months 7–12: Advanced — Threat hunting, forensics, detection engineering, certifications.

---

### Phase 1 — Foundations (must-have)

**Goal:** Networking, operating systems, and basic security concepts.

**Recommended videos/courses (search terms & channels):**

* “Network Fundamentals” — channels: NetworkChuck, professor Messer. **[Free/Paid mixture]**
* “Linux basics / command line” — channels: LearnLinuxTV, The Linux Foundation. **[Free]**
* “Windows Event Logs / PowerShell basics” — channels: Microsoft Learn, ITProTV. **[Free]**

**Books:**

* *CompTIA Network+ Study Guide* — any current edition. **[Paid]**
* *The Linux Command Line* — William Shotts. **[Free/Paid]**

---

### Phase 2 — Cybersecurity Essentials

**Goal:** Understand security fundamentals & common attacks.

**Courses / Paths:**

* **CompTIA Security+** — course and labs. **[Paid]**
* **TryHackMe: Introduction to Cyber Security** — TryHackMe path. **[Free tier / Paid labs]**
* **MITRE ATT&CK Intro** — search “MITRE ATT&CK for beginners” (videos and docs). **[Free]**

**Books:**

* *The Basics of Hacking and Penetration Testing* — Patrick Engebretson. **[Paid]**
* *The Practice of Network Security Monitoring* — Richard Bejtlich. **[Paid]**

---

### Phase 3 — SOC Core Skills (daily SOC)

**Goal:** Log analysis, SIEM usage, alert triage, and tuning.

**SIEM / Playlists & Docs:**

* **Splunk Fundamentals 1** (official training). **[Free — Splunk offers free training]**
* **Elastic Stack (ELK) for security** — Elastic docs & tutorials. **[Free]**
* **Microsoft Sentinel (Azure)** learning path. **[Free / Azure may cost for live ingestion]**

**Hands-on labs:**

* **TryHackMe — SOC Level 1** (guided labs). **[Free/Paid]**
* **BlueTeamLabsOnline** — practical blue team labs (some free, some paid). **[Paid/Free parts]**

**Tools to practice:** Splunk (free developer license), Elastic Stack, Security Onion, Zeek, Suricata, Filebeat/Winlogbeat.

**Books:**

* *Blue Team Handbook: SOC, SIEM, & Threat Hunting Use Cases* — Don Murdoch. **[Paid]**
* *Practical Splunk for Security* — (authors/edition vary). **[Paid]**

---

### Phase 4 — Incident Response & Forensics

**Goal:** Triage incidents, contain, eradicate, and do basic forensics.

**Courses & Videos:**

* Incident Response tutorials (SANS, Black Hills InfoSec). **[Paid/Free]**
* SANS FOR courses for deep forensic skills. **[Paid]**

**Books:**

* *Incident Response & Computer Forensics* — Jason Luttgens et al. **[Paid]**
* *The Art of Memory Forensics* — Michael Hale Ligh et al. **[Paid]**

---

### Phase 5 — Threat Hunting & Detection Engineering

**Goal:** Proactive hunting, write detections (Sigma), YARA, memory analysis.

**Resources:**

* Threat hunting videos & conference talks — Blue Team Village, CrowdStrike, Huntress. **[Free]**
* MITRE ATT&CK deep dives & case studies. **[Free]**

**Tools:** YARA, Volatility, Sigma rules, Splunk/ELK advanced queries.

**Books:**

* *Practical Cyber Threat Intelligence* — Dr. Wilson Bautista. **[Paid]**
* *Cybersecurity Blue Team Toolkit* — Nadean Tanner. **[Paid]**

---

### Phase 6 — Build a Home SOC Lab

**Goal:** Host a mini-SOC to produce real telemetry & practice detection/response.

**Components:**

* Windows VM(s) for client/server (forward Event Logs).
* Linux VM for Splunk/ELK/Security Onion.
* Security Onion (includes Zeek, Suricata, ELK).
* Kali Linux (attacker VM) or other attack VMs.
* Optional EDR trial (CrowdStrike, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint).

**Simplified steps:**

1. Deploy Security Onion or ELK + Beats (Filebeat/Winlogbeat).
2. Forward logs from Windows & Linux machines.
3. Simulate attacks from Kali (password spray, Lateral movement, phishing simulation).
4. Create detections, alerts, and dashboards; then tune to reduce false positives.

### Certifications (map to learning phases)

* **Beginner:** CompTIA Security+ **[Paid]**
* **SOC-focused:** EC-Council CSA (Certified SOC Analyst) **[Paid]**
* **SIEM:** Splunk certifications (User/Power User) **[Paid]**
* **Advanced:** GCIH, GCIA, OSCP (if moving into red/blue hybrid) **[Paid]**
* **Cloud SOC:** Microsoft SC-200 — Security Operations Analyst **[Paid]**

---

### Appendix — how to use this roadmap

* Follow phases sequentially. Pair videos with hands-on labs immediately. Practice > watch.
* Build your home SOC early. Keep a learning log: for each detection practiced, write a 1-page postmortem.
* Revisit MITRE ATT&CK when tuning detections — it maps adversary techniques to telemetry you should monitor.
